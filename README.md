# Standard-metabolic-rates
Standard metabolic rate values measured for temperate and tropical mayflies and stoneflies across various elevations

These data were collected using a closed-respirometery system. Data are corrected for background respiration, i.e., control chamber (without an insect) respiration rates were subtracted from treatment respiration rates for each temperature and elevation combination.
